Pets Unplugged is a creative venture by author Tony W Jackson, with artwork by Anna Nesterkaya. We create interactive coloring books that blend traditional coloring with modern animation via QR codes. Our mission is to encourage unplugging from screens while sparking creativity and joy through pet-themed adventures.
